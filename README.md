# player.html

The goal is to make a HTML5 music player in one standalone .html file.
The music files should be in subfolders of the player.html folder.

  /
  /player.html
  /musicdir1/a.ogg
  /musicdir1/b.ogg
  /musicdir1/c.ogg
  /musicdir2/a.ogg
  /musicdir2/b.ogg
  /musicdir2/c.ogg

An automatic recursive listing of the files should be created, with AJAX queries.

HTML5 audio elements will be used to play music.

There will be a way to adjust the audio volume.

The html content of the file should be minimal.
